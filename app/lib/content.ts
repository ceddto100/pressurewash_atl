    question: "Do I need to be home?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. As long as we can access the areas to be cleaned and the water source, we can perform the service and follow up with photos."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you need a water source?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Residential service uses the home’s exterior water spigot, and we’ll confirm access before arrival."
  },
  {
    question: "Is soft washing safe for siding?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Soft washing uses low pressure with the right solutions to remove organic growth without damaging siding."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take?",
    answer:
      "Most homes take 1–3 hours depending on size, staining, and surfaces. We’ll provide a time estimate with your quote."

  {
    question: "What about red clay stains?",
    answer:
      "Red clay is common in Metro Atlanta. We use targeted treatments to lift clay staining safely whenever possible."
